## Practice Guidelines
- Solve problems independently without AI assistance
- Focus on understanding patterns and approaches
- Time yourself for interview simulation
- Write clean, readable code
- Test your solutions thoroughly

## File Naming Convention
- `problem_name.py` or `problem_name.js`
- Include problem description as comments
- Add time/space complexity analysis
